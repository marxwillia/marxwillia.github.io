This paper presents the results the first comprehensive code comparison for supernova radiative transfer codes. A set of toy models is agreed upon and each code generates synthetic spectra and lightcurves for the toy models. These toy models are chosen to approximate SN Ia explosions. All toy models and results from all participating codes are publicly available.
