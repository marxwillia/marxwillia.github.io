excerpt: 'We present optical and UV data on SN2018gep, a supernova that exhibited a fast rise with blue, featureless spectra until after peak light, when the spectra developed broad features typically seen in SNe Ic-bl. Significant blue excess flux is observed compared to other stripped SNe.'

This paper presents photometric and spectroscopic data on SN2018gep. We show that SN2018gep experiences a fast rise time with extremely blue spectra similar to the newly observed class of transients called Fast Blue Optical Transients. The observed blue excess can be explained by an additional source of energy injection.
