permalink: /coauthorpubs/sn02bo
excerpt: 'We present the first application of the DALEK emulator-assisted TARDIS modeling framework to fit models to the SN Ia 2002bo. Posterior distributions over model parameters like elemental abundances are produced and comparisons are made to hydrodynamical models of different types of SN Ia explosion mechanisms.'

This paper presents the results the first comprehensive code comparison for supernova radiative transfer codes. A set of toy models is agreed upon and each code generates synthetic spectra and lightcurves for the toy models. These toy models are chosen to approximate SN Ia explosions. All toy models and results from all participating codes are publicly available.
