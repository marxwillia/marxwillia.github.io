This paper presents the largest set of SNe Icn to date, including two previously published objects (SN2019hgp, SN2021csp) and two newly published objects (SN2019jc, SN2021ckj). Explosion and progenitor properties are constrained by modeling their bolometric light curves. Some objects favor a low mass, ultra stripped progenitor, while others seem to favor Wolf-Rayet progenitors.
