excerpt: 'We present NIR and optical spectroscopy of SN Ic 2020oi and SN Ic-bl 2020bvc. The NIR spectrum of SN2020oi shows clear CO emission and is the first such dust detection for an SN Ic. SN2020bvc exhibits extremely high ejecta velocities consistent with SN-GRBs despite the lack of observed GRB.'

This paper presents data and analysis for SN Ic 2020oi and SN Ic-bl 2020bvc. NIR spectra for SN2020oi show clear CO emission, the first evidence of dust production from a SN Ic. SN2020oi may also show signs of Helium absorption. SN2020bvc exhibits extremely high ejecta velocities consistent with those measured for SNe Ic-bl associated with GRBs, indicating that the on-axis-unobserved GRB scenario may apply.
