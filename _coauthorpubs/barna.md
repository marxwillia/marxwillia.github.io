excerpt: 'We present UV spectroscopy and corresponding radiative transfer models using TARDIS of the normal SN Ia ASASSN-14lp which exhibits suppressed UV flux in its spectra. Models suggest that this UV suppression may be due to high levels of Ni56 mixing in the ejecta.'

This paper presents UV and optical spectra of SN Ia ASASSN-14lp. The observations show a suppressed UV flux which we investigate with the radiative transfer code TARDIS. Two possible explanations are tested: whether the UV suppression is due to high levels of Ni56 mixing within the ejecta, and whether a modified planck function at the photosphere could reproduce the observations.
