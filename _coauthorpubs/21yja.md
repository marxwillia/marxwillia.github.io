This paper presents ultraviolet and optical spectra of the young, nearby SN IIP 2021yja. Radiative transfer modeling shows that SN2021yja has a high velocity ejecta, low extinction, and subsolar metallicity. We do not find evidence of an additional heating source in the UV flux like one might expect from interaction with CSM.
