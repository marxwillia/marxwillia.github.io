In this paper we present data and radiative transfer models for SN Ic-bl 2014ad. These are the first published UV spectra 
of a SN Ic-bl and are consistent with broadened versions of normal SN Ic UV spectra. We show that SN2014ad has particularly 
high velocity ejecta, and modeling suggests a larger ejecta mass than previously estimated from the light curve.
