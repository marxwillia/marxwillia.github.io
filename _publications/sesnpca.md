This paper presents SESNPCA, a new spectral classifier for stripped envelope supernovae. We show that SESNPCA reproduces the basic taxonomy used by supernova researchers but provides added functionality, including quantitative outlier detection, uncertainty, and the ability to characterize transition supernovae.
