excerpt: 'During my PhD I was a TA for 5 courses at both the undergrad and graduate levels between 2016 and 2019:

1. Introductory Electronics Laboratory (undergrad)

2. Introductory Thermodynamics (undergrad, twice)

3. Mathematical Methods for Physicists (undergrad)

4. Computational Physics (graduate)


Each course required different management based on the student and instructor needs including experimental setup, homework design and solutions, exam design and solutions, supplemental lectures, and office hours.'

Introductory Electronics Laboratory
======
Before lab began, it was my responsibility to help set up experimental workstations for the students.
When students arrived, the first part of the lab consisted of a supplemental lecture I would design and give
to teach the students the theory behind the experiments they would be performing. The second part of lab 
required me to rotate between the students helping them debug hardware and software issues and answering questions.
Outside of lab it was my responsibility to grade student work.

Introductory Thermodynamics
======
As the TA for this course, I hosted 2 hour-long sections per week. Sections consisted of a lecture portion
and a problem solving portion. In the lecture portion, I prepared advanced material that expanded upon the
textbook readings and clarified particularly confusing concepts. The problem solving portion of section would
involve students working in small groups on worksheets that I designed to prepare them for the types of questions
they would be asked to solve on exams. For both iterations of this course it was my responsibility to create problem
sets and solutions for the students, and the instructor involved me in exam design and grading.

Mathematical Methods for Physicists
======
Despite this class's difficult reputation, it is one of my favorites to teach. Students typically struggle with this course
because of the ambitious breadth that included linear algebra, vector calculus, einstein notation, differential equations, 
and complex analysis. Therefore as the TA, my twice weekly hour-long sections were entirely lecture-based. I designed my own
lectures based on their textbook and my experience to provide alternative derivations and explanations, and I included example
problems with solutions in each lecture to demonstrate how the material could be applied. To make up for the lack of problem 
solving time in section, I held supplemental sections before both midterms and the final exam to give students more hands-on 
practice with the material. My duties for this class included designing and grading both midterms and the final exam.

Computational Physics
======
As the TA for the graduate level computational physics class required of all incoming PhD and masters students, I had a variety 
of responsibilities. First year students entered with a large spread of ability and exposure to programming, with some students 
having never used python before to some being seasoned experts. My sections in the beginning of the course focused on teaching 
python programming, git version control, and command line. I held office hours in order to provide one-on-one help to students 
who struggled with the assigned homework problems. During the latter half of the semester, my sections focused on supplementing 
the instructor lectures with advanced topics such as parallel programming, optimization, and machine learning.
