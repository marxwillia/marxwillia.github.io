excerpt: 'As an undergraduate student, I was a course instructor for the student designed and taught course Physics 91SI.
This was a for-credit course offered by the Stanford physics department and highly recommended by professors to undergraduates
interested in joining their labs and beginning research. The curriculum of the course was a combination of programming and 
data science in order to give students the foundational skills to conduct research. My duties included syllabus design, 
lecturing, homework design, office hours, and mentoring for the final projects. The syllabus is archived

Physics 91SI -- Practical Computing for Scientists
======
**Description:** This course teaches essential computer skills for researchers in the natural sciences, with a specific focus
on physics. The goal is to provide students with the essential and most powerful tools used in modern
research environments. The course will be taught primarily using the UNIX operating system and the
Python programming language, but with an eye toward the different computing environments used in
research situations.

By the end of this course, you should be a self­sufficient programmer and software user. This
means that you will be able to:

1. Navigate the UNIX operating system and use many of its powerful utilities, including shell
scripting, version control, and distributed filesystems.

2. Be confident using the Python program programming language, including advanced data
structures, object­oriented programming, functional programming, and debugging tools.

3. Use scientific analysis and plotting libraries and integrate Python with the operating system and
data workflow.

4. Plot and present data in an effective and informative manner.

5. Autonomously find, incorporate and learn to use the best external libraries for the task at hand.


**Schedule:** 2 hour lectures held twice per week.

**Lecture Format:** First half of class is lecture with demos, second half of class is lab.

**Curriculum:** Unix, shell scripting, python programming basics, python data structures, debugging, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, 
object oriented programming, functional programming, C and Cython, Mathematica, Matlab, Parallel programming, machine learning.

**Syllabus:** [Download Here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/physics91si/2014/handouts/91SISyllabus2014.pdf)

**Instructor Responsibilities:** Designing and giving lectures for the first half of class, designing laboratory exercises 
for the second half of class, curriculum design, grading, office hours.
